I add a little text with bbedit just t test if git only works we the configured editor or not.

let the text breath (and readers too!):

Body font size should be between 13-16px. (16 is actually better, even if it takes a little while to get accostumed it )

Headlines should be sized from next fibonacci value (21px)

Line-height is set with reference to this (1.5 is standard in typography books)

word spacing and letter spacing can also be tweaked... both for overall golden proportionality and to give a unique identity (with just the type)


body line-length should fall into the optimal 55-75 charatcters (10- 15 words per line) per line
(most sites reviewed from the article go up to 90ish) maybe this is good for us since we do have long pages.

some lines horiz/vert are usefull also see sibeboxes (no sidebars though it's more like an appended thing within the paragraph, vertically it should always fit in 2/3 of the screen height) considerations below in COPY

another metrics related to the 2 above is the line-length / line-height figure

gutter (first line indents)

paragraphs padding (borders) are crucial vor the final 'rythm' if the UI.

Lists: bullets are over (no way!), maybe a custom background gradient ...

Color scheme:

red yellow green from the logo should be generalized 


links: 

Footer: the large footer school can really find good application on epossite; list explicitly all documents (see http://www.activecollab.com/)

copy:
identify those paragraphs which are to be moved out of the main body; i.e. those insights that can go in sideboxes. this shortens the global and also adds variations to the graphical layout.

Main banner: the EPOS logo would be bigger 100% content width in my opinion

is the logo set or is it just another quickie for the previous deadline?!

The main tagline really needs work

NAvigation: (currently 9 confusing items)
Home -> goes into the logo
Objectives ->
Concept ->
PArtners ->

Impact -> 

e-SCience->

Governance->
Descrive i vari board direttivi 

Links-> would be better to have relevant links side by side each page content

Contacts-> can be linked in sidebar footer on each page

maximum five items in the main bar,


Homepage: you need a fast appealing prexy to explain what Epos is in 4main points (with 3-4 subpoints each) and a global mind map to navigate.


Rss (ported to twitter, facebook, email newsletter) and site Search do add a lot respectability to the site; ne


SEO considerations: Tagline and navigation item (page adrresses and titles)


il final step nella progettazione sarebbe:
Analisi dei 'personaggi' e loro scenari di utilizzo ....

Problema globale: i personaggi coinvolti sono accustomed a siti tipo cordis, FP7 che sono manuali di inusabilità e di USerExperience orribili; fare una cosa fatta bene rischia di scioccarli e farli sentire disorientati, anche perchè sono probabilmente 50++.

In generale hanno color schemes sul bluino azzurrino

Ancora meglio coadiuvare il tutto con 2-3 sessioni di user testing del prototipo
(scenari e task da valutare ??!?)



the overall visual organization is poor, small fonts, no spacing etc; but before working on the layout the whole content should be reprased: 


navigation is abstract and unclear, too many buttons on one level

before anythingthough we need to map content as a user would do -> card sorting
