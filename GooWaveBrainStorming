WAve brainstoriming


after a while most of the message/replies are superfluos, a better way to consolidate (evolve) the wave is needed (other than deleting sub-Threads)

Editing rich txt etc
???

Adding people -> groups?

Attaching documents or recycling them into the Wave editor ->Z final result for many people is a .doc so an export button is needed.

Ubiquity integration ?

searching within a wave (+close-all for threads etc) ?!?

blogy Wordpress integration

not bvery usable! following more than 2 people in realtime gets impossible ewith messages being moved vertically by other people new lines

now if all where collaborating on a single text would be a bit better but still very messy.

Public Waves are just a mess this is really not the way to go; turn out twitter interface 'guessed' the right balance between real-time typing and posting a new update/reply
